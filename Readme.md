>By Ridhiman Dhindsa 

# Description 
The health of an indiviual is predicted, based on factors such as Hours of sleep (1-12),  Exercise (0-180 min), Nutrition in diet on a scale of 0-100, Genetic classification (3 classes) etc. Output is health on a scale of 0-100, where 0 indicates poor and 100 indicates good health.
It is observed that after performing feature scaling and one-hot encoding, the outputs are more accurate and readable.
> NOTE: The dataset used consists of randomly generated data points.
